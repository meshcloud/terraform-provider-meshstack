# meshstack_building_block_v2 (Data Source)

Single building block by UUID.

~> **Note:** This resource is in preview. It's incomplete and will change in the near future.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "meshstack_building_block_v2" "example" {
  metadata = {
    uuid = "e2cc9cbb-cf1d-4dc0-8461-64140110b6dc" # Building block UUID
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Building block metadata. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) Building block datatype version
- `kind` (String) meshObject type, always `meshBuildingBlock`.
- `spec` (Attributes) Building block specification. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
- `status` (Attributes) Current building block status. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `uuid` (String) UUID which uniquely identifies the building block.

Read-Only:

- `created_on` (String) Timestamp of building block creation.
- `marked_for_deletion_by` (String) For deleted building blocks: user who requested deletion.
- `marked_for_deletion_on` (String) For deleted building blocks: timestamp of deletion.
