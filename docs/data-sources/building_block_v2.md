## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Building block metadata. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) Building block datatype version
- `kind` (String) meshObject type, always `meshBuildingBlock`.
- `spec` (Attributes) Building block specification. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
- `status` (Attributes) Current building block status. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `uuid` (String) UUID which uniquely identifies the building block.

Read-Only:

- `created_on` (String) Timestamp of building block creation.
- `marked_for_deletion_by` (String) For deleted building blocks: user who requested deletion.
- `marked_for_deletion_on` (String) For deleted building blocks: timestamp of deletion.
- `owned_by_workspace` (String) The workspace containing this building block.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `building_block_definition_version_ref` (Attributes) References the building block definition this building block is based on. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--building_block_definition_version_ref))

- `inputs` (Attributes Map) Contains all building block inputs. Each input has exactly one value attribute set according to its' type. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--inputs))
- `parent_building_blocks` (Attributes List) List of parent building blocks. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--parent_building_blocks))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) References the building block target. Depending on the building block definition this will be a workspace or a tenant (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--building_block_definition_version_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.building_block_definition_version_ref`

### Nested Schema for `spec.target_ref`

Read-Only:

- `identifier` (String) Identifier of the target workspace.
